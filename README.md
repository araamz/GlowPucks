# GlowPucks 
THe GlowPucks project was created as a part of the final project for the EE 426: Microprocessor Applications at the University of Nevada, Reno. The purpose of the project is to create a replacement device that can temporarily replace conventional street refelectors for interfacing with drivers. The GlowPuck can interface drivers through different lightmodes and work along side other GlowPuck devices. The project features a technology stack from the embedded device to a frontend user interface. Different communication protocols such as MQTT and REST API that are used through differnt parts of the data pipeline along with different languages to power the technology stack.

## Technologies Used in the Project
The project uses the following technology stack for the **frontend design**:
* React
* React Router
* JavaScript/TypeScript
* SocketIO

The project uses the following technology stack for the **backend design**:
* Flask
* Flask-MQTT
* Flask-SocketIO

The project uses the following technology stack for the **Raspberry Pi 3 Model B design**:
* Eclipse Mosquitto

The project uses the following technology stack for the **ESP32-C3 design**:
* ESP-IDF MQTT Client

## Further Documentation
More specific details about the embedded design of the project can be found in the slide deck *GlowPuck Slide Deck.pdf*.

## Updates To Project
The project will be refreshed with active development continuing at [GlowPucks-Reloaded](https://github.com/araamz/GlowPucks-Reloaded).
